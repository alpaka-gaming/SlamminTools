# Slammin' tools for Source 2013 SP and MP

## What is this?
I wanted to create some tools that would revitalise Source (2013) modding, building on the improvements presented by other popular compile tools, such as Amckern's CST and HAVOK's HCC tools. As well tools for other games entirely, such as Tyrutils for Quake, and VHLT for Goldsrc.

These tools bring along a bunch of really slammin' cool improvements, not only for the compile tools, but to Hammer itself as well.
The big cool changes are baked ambient occlusion for vrad, and tons of nice UI updates for Hammer, the old FP thread linked later has all the info.

After 12 months in the making, hopefully its been worth the wait.
